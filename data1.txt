with the developement of our society peoples lifestyle change from day to day it has become more common for people to 
have different parttime jobs compared this trend with before some people start wondering whether it is good or bad for
people to have many jobs at the same time however in my opinion i think parttime job is a double sides sword it has its 
own advantages and disadvantages for some people parttime jobs provide them an oppotunity to do things they are actually 
interested in also it offers the possibility to earn more money at the same time but for other people parttime jobs are 
time consuming and they cost many energy to do so many jobs at the same time period the most important advantage of parttime jobs 
is that they provide an oppotunity for people to try different things taking my brother as an example he works in a bank 
as a teller but he has seen many videos about bartender so he decides to be a bartender at night this job extends his 
sight and provides him a chance to fulfill his dream speaking of dreams parttime jobs also offer people a chance to 
earn more money parttime jobs are the best path for someone who needed money although it takes time people could still 
benefit from the work they did in our society many people take parttime jobs in order to make enough money to pay bills 
or pay for their kids tuition however as we all know it takes time and energy to do so many jobs this is the most disadvantage 
of parttime jobs people get tired and stressed because of their work they dont have time with families all they want to do is 
finishing the job and sleep if a father takes several parttime jobs it may influence on his children his children may lack of love and
